/**
 * An out-of-schedule, admin-initiated run of a job by name — the hook behind a
 * "run now" / "retry" button on a run-history admin screen.
 *
 * "Retry" and "run now" are the same operation: `run()` calls `findDueItems()`
 * fresh, so if the job is **level-triggered** (returns what is *still* due — the
 * shape this module asks for), the items that failed last run are still due and
 * are retried. It is not per-item retry — `failedItemRefs` are opaque strings,
 * and the runner can't turn one back into an item to process alone. Per-item
 * retry state is a Model 2 concern.
 *
 * `trigger()` awaits the whole run. For a job that can take a while, the
 * consumer's controller should not hold the HTTP request open — fire it and
 * return `202`, then let the admin screen poll the run history:
 * `void jobTrigger.trigger(name)`. The advisory lock still prevents a
 * double-click from starting a second run.
 *
 * Gate the endpoint with the app's own `Authorizer` — a manual job run is a
 * privileged operation. This service does no authorization of its own.
