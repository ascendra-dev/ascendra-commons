/**
 * Postgres session-level advisory locks (Model 1). hashtext() folds an
 * arbitrary string key into the bigint pg_try_advisory_lock() needs, so
 * callers never manage numeric lock ids themselves. Session-scoped locks are
 * released automatically by Postgres when the holding connection closes, so
 * a crashed process never leaves one stuck — nothing here has to handle that
 * case explicitly.
 *
 * REQUIRED — the provider behind SQL_EXECUTOR must give tryAcquire() and
 * release() the *same* physical session. A session-level lock belongs to one
 * connection; if the two calls land on different connections of a pool, the
 * unlock is a no-op on a connection that never held the lock, the real holder
 * keeps the lock until it is idle-closed, and the job silently skips every run
 * in between. So:
 *   - Never point SQL_EXECUTOR at a transaction-mode pooler (PgBouncer /
 *     Supabase "Transaction pooler") — session-level advisory locks are
 *     unsupported there.
 *   - Give SQL_EXECUTOR a dedicated single connection, distinct from the app
 *     pool — e.g. `drizzle(new Pool({ max: 1, idleTimeoutMillis: 0 }))` — so
 *     acquire and release always share one session.
 * release() logs a WARN if pg_advisory_unlock reports the lock was not held:
 * the canary that one of the above is misconfigured. See the module README.
