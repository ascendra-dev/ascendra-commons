/**
 * The atomic claim for Postgres/Drizzle (Model 1). Corresponding table:
 * `persistence/idempotency-key.schema.ts` (DDL: `migrations/`).
 *
 * `claim()` is one `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE … WHERE (stale) … RETURNING` —
 * atomic regardless of node, the guarantee from Postgres's conflict handling on
 * the `(key, scope)` primary key. A fresh insert *and* a stale-reclaim both
 * return one row (`rows.length === 1` = "I own it"); a recent-pending or
 * completed conflict returns zero, and the fallback read classifies it.
 *
 * `(xmax = 0) as inserted` (a standard Postgres idiom) is how that one atomic
 * statement also tells a brand-new row apart from a reclaimed one: `xmax` is
 * the deleting-transaction id Postgres stamps on every row version, `0` on a
 * row nobody has ever updated. A plain `INSERT` produces `xmax = 0`; the `DO
 * UPDATE` branch produces a new row version with `xmax != 0`. No second query,
 * no race — `reclaimedStale` falls straight out of the same statement that
 * won the claim. `reclaim_count` is incremented in that same `DO UPDATE SET`,
 * so counting a reclaim can never itself race the claim it's counting.
 *
 * Every claim carries a fresh `claim_id`. `complete()` is guarded
 * `WHERE claim_id = $claimId`, so a claim reclaimed as stale (its `claim_id`
 * overwritten by the new owner) can no longer write its response — its
 * `complete()` is a 0-row no-op instead of corrupting the current owner's
 * cached response. This does not stop the duplicate side-effect (once a
 * still-in-flight claim is reclaimed by time, both run) — it keeps the cache
 * consistent with what the current owner's client saw. That no-op is now
 * itself recorded (`late_complete_no_op_count`, logged) rather than silently
 * discarded — it's the one unambiguous signal that a duplicate actually ran.
