/**
 * A tiny time-based memo. Notification config (routing, templates, credentials)
 * changes rarely, but `Notifier.notify()` + each sender read it on every send —
 * a batch job doing hundreds of notifications would otherwise fire hundreds of
 * identical queries. A short TTL collapses that with a bounded staleness
 * window; a change is visible after at most `ttlMs`.
 *
 * Per-process, not shared (no Redis) — same posture as the authorization
 * family's per-request cache, just time-bounded rather than request-bounded
 * because a batch job has no request. `ttlMs <= 0` disables it entirely.
 *
 * Stack-agnostic — it lives here in the family package, so a MySQL (or any
 * other) `NotificationConfig` adapter reuses it rather than re-implementing.
