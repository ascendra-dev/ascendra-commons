/**
 * The computation behind a project's own `GET /me` endpoint — not a shipped
 * controller, since the route, DTO shape, and the full list of actions that
 * exist are all project-specific. A consuming project writes a thin
 * controller calling this:
 *
 *   @Get('me')
 *   async me(@CurrentUser() actor: Actor) {
 *     return computeSessionSnapshot(actor, Object.values(Actions), this.authorizer);
 *   }
 *
 * Fetched once at session bootstrap by the frontend. Menus/routes are hidden
 * based on membership in allowedActions — never disabled, since a persona
 * that can never do something should not see it at all (see this module's
 * README, "Hide vs. disable").
 *
 * If the authorizer implements `allowedActions` (the database-backed adapter
 * does), this resolves in one call — one query, not one per action. Otherwise
 * it falls back to calling `can()` per action; fine for an in-memory
 * authorizer, a needless N+1 against a database one.
