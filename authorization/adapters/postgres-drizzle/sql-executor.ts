/**
 * The minimal shape this adapter needs from the consumer's database client —
 * deliberately not the consumer's full schema-typed Drizzle client, so the
 * adapter never depends on any project's generated schema. Same reasoning as
 * `background-jobs` / `idempotency-key` / the audit-logging adapter; duplicated
 * here rather than imported so `authorization/` stays independently copyable
 * (and a consumer that deletes `adapters/` for a different stack takes this
 * with it).
 *
 * Any Drizzle pg database — `NodePgDatabase`, `PostgresJsDatabase`, a Supabase
 * pooled client wrapped the same way — satisfies this structurally.
